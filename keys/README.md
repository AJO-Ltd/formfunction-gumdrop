# Test Keypairs

These are throwaway keys for devnet and testnet. They should not be used for production deploys.

The keys are stored in separate folders for `devnet` and `testnet`, but we are using the same keypairs and addresses on each network for testing, which are:

* `config-authority-keypair`: `dcfg6CukQFmVzXdYu31wmTM6d6rvVXhnMEn1dzpCGco`.
* `deployer-keypair`: `G1K5YZmhg1LqaYUC9VXWK7YLCdwqJcVPLpgBt5tmUWVf`.
* `program-keypair`: `dgumN6t8fDjoHAbb1K4ySqcP2sWJHaqX9JLNQMDPT9U`.
